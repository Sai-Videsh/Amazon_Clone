# Amazon_Clone
I created a clone of the Amazon landing page using HTML and CSS. The project replicates the header, navigation bar, hero section, product listings, promotional banners, and footer. It focuses on achieving visual similarity and responsive design, showcasing my skills in web development and styling.
